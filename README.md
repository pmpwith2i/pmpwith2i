## Hello, I'm Federico ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Software Engineer with strong foundations in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, Node.js, and React.

Thanks to my passion and continuous learning, I started working at 17. Over the past 10+ years, Iâ€™ve held roles such as Cloud Developer, Full Stack Engineer, Senior Backend Engineer, and Tech Lead.
Iâ€™m the kind of software engineer who focuses on performance optimization, clean code, and robust testing strategies.

Iâ€™ve been passionate about the crypto space and Web3 development since the early days. Iâ€™ve written smart contracts in Solidity (EVM) and Rust (Solana), and Iâ€™m now transitioning toward a career as a Smart Contract Engineer.
